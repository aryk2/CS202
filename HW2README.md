Object Oriented Programming Introduction

This program was a homework assingment that focused mainly on object oriented programming
and data structures. The main goal was to create a class hierarchy of vehicles with a common
vehicle class and then subclasses that signify types of vehicles. These objects were stored 
in a doublely linked list of vehicle pointers with each pointer being assigned a subclass
using upcasting. The program has the functionality of adding, removing, searching, managing
vehicle usage and displaying all.
